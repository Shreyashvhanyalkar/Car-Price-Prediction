# Car-Price-Prediction

This Car Price Prediction project is a web-based application that utilizes a Machine Learning model (Linear Regression) to estimate the price of a used car based on user input. It is built using Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript for the frontend. The app allows users to select the carâ€™s company, model, manufacturing year, fuel type, and enter the number of kilometers driven. Once the details are submitted, the frontend sends the data via AJAX to the Flask server, which uses the trained ML model to predict the price and returns the result instantly without reloading the page. The dataset used for training is a cleaned version of used car listings, and the model is saved using pickle. The UI is responsive and user-friendly, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning into a full-stack web application.
